# LMSE_Code_2023_Summer

Code written to help develop a protocol to produce sets of KO's that will force cooperation between two organissms, given their genome scale models as an input.

Codes 1,2, and 3 are written by Alexandre Tremblay, with minor edits made by me to get them to work with Codes 4 and 5, which are written by me.
